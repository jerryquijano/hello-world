# hello-world
hello world, creating a repository in hopes of learning how to make audiograms. I really want this to work!

Hey friends,

I feel like I have been slacking in terms of creating things this semsester. I have done a lot of adminstrative work, but I am lacking in creative work. I am tired of dragging through my life. If I ever want to get better, I have to start NOW.
